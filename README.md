# Personal Portfolio Project
### Author: Nikita Upadhyay

## 📂 Summary  
The website you're currently viewing is a fully responsive portfolio designed to showcase my academic projects, technical skills, and professional experience. It was initially prototyped using Mobirise to establish the layout and structure, then customized in Visual Studio Code by directly modifying the HTML and asset files. I enhanced the functionality and styling to reflect personal branding goals, ensuring a clean, consistent design, smooth navigation, and compatibility across all devices.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Responsive layout that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices**
- **Sections for:**
  - Academic and personal projects
  - Technical skill highlights
  - Resume and contact information
- **Clean, minimal design for clarity and focus**
- **Custom styling to maintain aesthetic consistency**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Mobirise** – Used as the design skeleton for initial layout and components
- **HTML5 / CSS3** – Customized site content, structure, and styling
- **JavaScript** – Light scripting to support interactivity and user experience
- **Visual Studio Code** – Primary code editor for customization and development
